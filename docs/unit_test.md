- Use codium.ai to generate tests automatically.
  - https://www.codium.ai/

- Similarly look for a way to generate meaningful docstring

  - This video explains why to use setup.cfg file along with setup.py and other concerns.
  - pip install -e . (this makes a link to the package in virtualenv, it is based on setup.py, setup.cfg)
  - This is amazing video.

  - setup.py, setup.cfg can be used to run linting, test and all sort of things on the project
  - test decorators @pytest.mark.parameterize() or @pytest.mark.skip(reason='regex not supported yet')
  - @pytes.fixture(scope='session')
  - test can depend on fixtures and fixtures can depend on fixtures. 
- tox
  - tox allows to create many virtual environment and install packages in those environment and run the test in all those.
